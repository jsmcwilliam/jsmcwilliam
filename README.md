- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsmcwilliam, a retired dentist who immigrated fromScotland in 1967 to take up a post as
junior research assistant at the Karolinska Dental School in Stockholm. Since then I studied postgraduate 
to become an orthodontist and have worked in that capacity in both Saudi Arabia and Kenya, however my last
position before retiring was as a private orthodontist in Eslöv.
- 👀 I’m interested in Music and still play my clarinet in the Malmö Police Band and a chamber music trio 
in Lund. Coming from Scotland I play the Highland Bagpipes mainly during the summer months when living in
our summer cottage on the shore of Ringsjön, outside Eslöv. I also have an interest in computers and this
has been a useful complement to my music activities. I copy and arrange music using Finale for the classical 
stuff and Lilypond for my pipe music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use the scanning software SmartScore to restore old faded sheet music. In 
addition to this I am far from fully taught in the use of Finale and Lilypond - this is an ongoing process.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above.
- 📫 How to reach me is best achieved via my email adress: jsmcwilliam@gmail.com .
